Title: Calculates decay rate coefficients and concentrations for experimental data from endpoint dilution assays (MPN)
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Simon Meister and Matthew Verbyla
Maintainer: Matthew Verbyln a <mverbyla@sdsu.edu>
Description: Calculates the psuedo-first-order rate coefficient from a decay curve experiment where endpoint dilutions 
    are used to measure the concentration. This is
    The package also has a function that calculates the MPN concentration for a single sample based on raw data from an 
    endpoint dilution assay.
